* lite-xl-command-line
make status bar a command line for user and modules
it will not execute commands but launches the execution

* Install

git clone in your plugins folder

* Usage
in your config or module: 

#+begin_src lua
local command_line = require "plugins.lite-xl-command-line"
command_line.set_prompt("Vimxl") -- choose your prompt

-- vimxl case
-- vimxl already provides:
-- execute_command: to launch functions 
-- get_suggested_commands: to get suggestions 
local vim_functions = require "plugins.vimxl.functions"
vim_functions["vimxl-normal:command-mode"] = function(state)
  command_line.start_command{
    submit = function(user_input)
      state:execute_command(user_input)
    end,
    suggest = function(user_input)
      return state:get_suggested_commands(user_input)
    end
  }
end
#+end_src

Currently, suggestions are just a hint. taking the suggestion input is not yet implemented.
so you need to continue typing.

* Config
you can clear the status bar and show only commad_line by setting
it needs reboot each time.

#+begin_src lua
command_line.minimal_status_view = true
#+end_src
